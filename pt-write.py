# This script takes a source material and stores each unique word in it as an entry in a python dictionary.

# Each entry in the dictionary (for word w) is a tuple of (frequency(w), subdictionary1, subdictionary2)

# subdictionary1 is a dictionary of all words that have occurred one after w
# subdictionary2 is a dictionary of all words that have occurred two after w

# Subdictionary entries have the exact same format as dictionary entries
# e.g. D['foo'][sub1]['zoo'] is a tuple of (frequency(zoo|foo),subdict1,subdict2)
# Where those subdictionaries are now dictionaries of words that follow 'zoo' GIVEN THAT 'zoo' followed 'foo'

sub2 = 2    #possible words after next word

# for the likely next word.

# 1. words likely to follow the most recent word you typed
# 2. words likely to follow 2 after the second most recent word
# 3. words likely to satisfy both of the above conditions (i.e., following that 2-gram sequence)
# 4. the baseline frequency of words in the source
